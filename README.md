## Description
This program explores the use of machine learning through neural networks. It uses the features in the provided dataset to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans based on credit ranking. 

## Project Status
The code is at a stable state. May revise the code in order to further understand supervised machine learning models.

## Conditions
The specifications for this program is that it is running on Python 3.10.14 for a Conda environment and imported pandas, Dense and Ssequential from tensorflow, train_test_split, StandardScaler, and classification_report from scikit-learn, and pathlib from Path.
